	# 1. Add Express Endpoint

You are building a legendary jokes server, a server with jokes sourced from the best comedians on the planet. So far you've gotten one endpoint to work. Almost there!

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test # <-- Make this pass!
```

## Requirements

Add a `POST /chats` endpoint to your express server to save a new joke in your `jokes` array. Run `npm test` and ensure your code passes.

## Tips

Don't let long error messages scare you; inspect it closely for relevant information.
