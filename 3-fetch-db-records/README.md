		# 3. Fetch DB Records

A toy database is set up for you. Your task is to grab data from it!

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test # <-- Make this pass!
```

## Requirements

- [x] Fill in the function in `exercise-3.js` to make the tests pass.

## Tips

- When diving into a project, always start by reading the tests. Make sure they make sense, too â€“ tests are not always 100% correct!
